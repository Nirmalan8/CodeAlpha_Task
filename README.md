# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification Project

This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species â€” **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** â€” using various classification algorithms.

---

##  Project Overview

The Iris Flower Classification project uses the famous **Iris dataset** to train models that can predict the species of an iris flower based on the following features:

- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

---

##  Objectives

- Load and explore the Iris dataset
- Perform data preprocessing and visualization
- Train and evaluate different classification models
- Compare model performance and select the best one

---

##  Dataset

The dataset used is the classic **Iris Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains **150 rows** and **5 columns**:
- 4 numeric input features
- 1 categorical target (species)

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis

- Correlation heatmap
- Pairplot visualization
- Value counts of target variable
- Checking for missing values

---

##  Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report

---

##  Results

The models achieved high accuracy. The best performing model(s) had:
- **Accuracy:** Over 95% on test data
- **Low misclassification error**
- **High precision and recall**
